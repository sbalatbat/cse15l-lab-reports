# Lab Report 5: Week 8 & 9
*I really enjoyed learning about `find` and its options on [Lab Report 3](https://sbalatbat.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/Lab_Report_3.html) so I will apply the same procedure to `grep`.*

## Researching Commands: `grep`

**What does `grep` do?**
`grep` searches input files for matches to the given pattern(s). It copies the line containing a match into standard output by default, or produces other output based on specified options.

__Command-line options__
* `-e`
* `-n`
* `--color`
* `-r`

### `-e`

`-e` is the flag for the pattern that the user wants to match again. Using `-e` before every pattern that the user wants to use allows for `grep` to search for all patterns given. This is useful for searching for multiple strings at once.

Example 1
```
$ # working directory TO EDIT
$ 
```

Example 2
```
$ # TO EDIT
```
